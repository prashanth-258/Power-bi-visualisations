### About this project

AtliQo is one of the leading 5G provider in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers. This report shows the comparison report of KPIs between pre- and post-periods of the 5G launch at various labels. As Management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post 5G launch in May 2022.

### Insights

1) The revenue reached its peak in February but has slightly decreased over the following two months. Despite 
   this decline, the revenue remains higher than before the launch of 5G, by approximately 0.05%.
2) Following the 5G launch, the revenue has picked up pace, and surprisingly, the ARPU has increased by 11.1%. 
   This suggests that an expansion in the active user base could lead to a significant revenue boost.
3) Pune and Chennai stand out as the cities with negative ARPU.
4) 13 out of 15 cities have experienced decrease in active users.
5) Except for Mumbai, all cities have witnessed a significant increase in unsubscribers, with Lucknow experiencing the highest at 77.9%.
6) Plan 1 remains the company's top-selling product and has shown even stronger performance since the introduction of 5G.
